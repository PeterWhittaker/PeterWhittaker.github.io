<p class="lead">Another Facebook-inspired post, this one in response to a rant by an ignoramus calling civil servants "weak", "inept", and "incompetent" because they take so much time off for mental illness, who wishes they were in charge so that they could fire the worst of them and force the rest into line. This is my not-quite-friendly response. Their names appears herein PersonX.</p>

I'm a security consultant. The federal government is my largest client. Every time I work on a project that takes me on site, a project where I work closely with civil servants, I thank the fates, the stars, the flying spaghetti monster, and everything else holy and unholy that I am contractor and not an employee.

I have rarely seen worse work environments, I have rarely seen staff so overburdened, with so little management support. Workloads increase quarterly, sometimes monthly, headcounts are reduced just as frequently, budgets both macro and micro are cut.

PersonX, I don't know you that well, and I apologize if I offend, but you are an ignorant git talking out your asshole.

A colleague and occasional client, a hard working dedicated professional of long employment in the civil service, a man whose work ethic rivals anything I've seen private sector or public, is so beaten down by the increasing pressures of ever increasing workloads, diminished headcounts, increasing reporting requirements (hey, things are poor, let's get more data, more reporting to figure out why, hey, things slowed down, let's get more data, more reporting to figure out why, hey, things slowed down, repeat ad depressium), that I fear for his mental health. And when he goes, his department will be fucked, because he understands both how things do work and how they should work.

He is burning himself out to protect you, PersonX. Yes, you. Because he is a security manager in a department responsible for your tax dollars and your private information. If he is not allowed to do his job properly, your money will be wasted and your identity put at risk.

This same person had to buy pens and pencils and paper pads for his staff out of his own pocket, and may have to buy toner for the printers out of his own pocket, so that his people can do their work, because budgets are that badly cut.

How strong are you, PersonX? Can you bench press 100lb? 200lb? What if I drop 500lb on your chest? A 1000lb? Will you collapse because you are inept? Incompetent? Weak. Putz.
