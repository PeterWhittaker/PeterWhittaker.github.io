Professionally, I work with [Sphyrna Security Inc.](http://www.sphyrnasecurity.com) My main focus is business development, primarily for our Compliance Automation Platform, with the Unidirectional Gateway filling in my spare time.

Socially, you can find me on

* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/PeterWhittaker),
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/EdgeKeep),
* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/PeterWhittaker),
* [/.](http://slashdot.org/~myvirtualid/), 
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PeterWhittaker), and
* [GitHub](http://github.com/PeterWhittaker).

My favourite hobbies are off-roading, acting, and writing, from time to time. You're in the right place for the writing part.

For acting, check out

* My [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3945839/) entry,
* My [Kanata Theatre](http://kanatatheatre.com/Archive/actors/w/whittpet.htm) page, or
* Watch and listen to some of my work on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5faqvscfwfocIuqoCFlb_Zn048YFGm4y).

Summer weekends are spent driving over rocks. Check out the [EOTB photo gallery on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/EOTBOpenForum/photos/?filter=albums) for evidence.... Interested in joining us off-road? [I wrote a page about how to do that!](http://eotb.ca/how-to-join)

Occasionally I play stringed instruments of various types, with picks or bows (definitely prefer the ones with bows). Relieved you should be that evidence of that spared you I have.
