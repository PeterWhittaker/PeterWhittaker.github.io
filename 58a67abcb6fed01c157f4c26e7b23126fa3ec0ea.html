		<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Today we're going to demonstrate an exciting new technology - but we're not going to talk about that technology.
		<p>Instead, we are going to show an operational scenario that you are familar with - and we're going to show operators on the ground doing things that are hard to do today, sometimes impossible, at least in real time. You won't see the technology, but you'll see it at work, you'll see how what it makes possible.
		<p>The only thing I'll ask you to remember about this technology is its name: Data-Centric Security.

		<p>We're not going to walk through the scenario in real time. We're going to highlight a few key points in a scenario like this. Specifically, we are going to show you:
		<ol>
		<li>The Canadian hospital team, the French response team, and NATO tactical command discussing the case in a secure chatroom - with an EYES ONLY sidebar
		<li>An evolving Situational Awareness picture in which the operational picture shown to each partner changes with their authorization - you guessed it, we're going to bring in some bad guys and a Partner for Peace, and
		<li>Emailing of medical records from US to Canadian forces, on the NATO mission network, with that information USA and CDN EYES ONLY
		</ol>
		<p>So let's look at that first step: NATO tactical command, the Canadian hospital, and the French response team on the British helo access a chat room

	<div class="slideFooter">
		<p>Ladies and gentlemen, what you're seeing right now is a live chat session between Canadian, French, and NATO operators.
		<p>These operators represent the Canadian team in the hospital, the French team on the helo, and the NATO team in the AWAC.
		<p>Everything is taking place over the NATO mission network, but....
		<p>At one point, the Canadian team realizes they need to have a sidebar discussion - but want to keep everything in one place.
		<p>With currently deployed technology, this cannot be done. Field technology is fortress technology.
		<p>With Data-centric security, this is easy. Capt/Mr/Ms _____?
		<p>If you look the window on the right, you'll our Canadian operator labelling individual messages as CDN EYES ONLY.
		<p>Now if you to the window on the left, you'll see that those Canadian messages appear in the NATO chat room, but are encrypted.
		<p>Any Canadian operator authorized to access this chatroom will see those messages. No one else can. It doesn't matter if that Canadian is in the hospital or back home in Ottawa. They can see these messages.
		<p>Likewise, French operators on that British helo can have a French eyes-only sidebar conversation, and all that the Canadians, and everyone else will see, is that there are French eyes only encrypted messages in the chat room.
		<p>We cannot do this in the field today. Because field systems are based on old thinking, the fortress mentality, all or nothing, system high.
		<p>Data-centric security allows us to segregate information on a shared network, to better manage access controls, to better control authorization, to make changes on the fly - which you'll see very clearly, in our situational awareness example, which is up next
		<p>But before we leave the chat example, I'd like to draw your attention to something very special: The French team on the British helo has full access to French national systems and protections: They are essentially operating as an MNX within the British MNE. Data-centric security allows us to achieve the full potential of FMN.
		<p>And before you ask whether or not this is real, let me say this: Our next several days of testing here in Bydgoszcz are exactly this scenario. We are going to have French and Czech (possily Turkish, HUngarian) operating with simulated MNXs hosted by our Canadian MNE right here in this room.
		<p>Comments or questions before we move on?
		<p>Excellent. Let's turn to the situational awareness view.

		<p>Let's move forward in time. Our Canadian operator is using their Situational Awareness tool to determine the helo's ETA to the US unit, in order to estimate the likely ETA of the casualties.

		<p>On the ground, things are more complicated....

	</div>
	<div class="slideFooter">
		<p>As you can see, the display on the left is similar to the display on the right, but has additional information
		<p>This is the total operational view from the AWAC: NATO tactical command sees not only all our Coalition friendlies, but a group of bad guys they've been tracking...
		<p>...and our Finnish Partners for Peace who've been keeping an eye on these bad guys. We haven't shown bad guys up until now, they haven't been germane to the scenario - the US soldier could have been wounded in combat, in training, or there could have been an accident. From the MEDEVAC perspective, what mattered is evacuation and transportatioin to a field hospital
		<p>But that has changed: The Finns are reporting that the bad guys are setting up anti-aircraft batteries. They may mean to threaten our helo.
		<p>This information is needed by everyone involved.
		<p>Keep your eyes on the screen on the right, the Canadian view, which currently shows friendlies.
		<p>NATO tactical command makes a few mouse clicks, and the previously privileged information about the Finnish Defense Forces and the bad guys is now releasable to these US, CDN, FRA, and GBR teams - possibly only to them.
		<p>What matters is that the total situational awareness picture has been updated in real time to reflect changes in need to know.
		<p>All of our friendlies now see another friendly, and the bad guys.
		<p>The British pilot can take appropriate action. The Canadian hospital can adjust its ETA estimates - and prepare for the possibility of wounded from the helo itself.
		<p>PAUSE.
		<p>I want to let that sink in.
		<p>Today in the field? Completely impossible.
		<p>With Data-centric? Easy.
		<p>And again, if you doubt me, we've been testing this all week with our American and British partners. We've been demonstrating cross-domain sharing of situational awareness information with simulated real-time changes in access rights, in authorization.
		<p>This is real, in the lab, today. We are working to make it field ready. Give us time.
		<p>Any questions before we move on?
		<p>All right, let's turn to our last example, eyes only email on a mission network.

		<p>The Canadian hospital is getting ready to treat an American casualty. They are not the only hospital in the area, but they were the best choice based on relative position, what was known about the injury, etc.
		<p>I'm not a doctor, I don't know how that all works. But I do know the Canadian hospital needs the US soldier's medical history.
		<p>Exchanging that sort of information today is tough. Who sends it? Who receives it?
		<p>PAUSE
		<p>In our data-centric future world, sending this information is, well, easy.
		<p>Take a look at the screens
		<p>A member of the US unit has attached the soldier's medical history to an email. That email is addressed to "Canadian Field Hospital Baltic One"
		<p>Not to a particular Canadian doctor, nurse, orderly, or administrator. To the hospital's generic email account.
		<p>Watch as the US soldier sends the email.
		<p>Watch it appear in the Canadian inbox a few seconds later.
		<p>That was quick.
		<p>Email is so familiar to us, we expect it to be quick. It's all the heavy lifting that happened under the covers.
		<p>That email is secure as it travels on the US network. With full US security labelling and US national protection.
		<p>It is secure as it travels over the Coalition network, with Coalition labelling and Coalition protections.
		<p>And it is secure on the Canadian network, with Canadian national protections and Canadian labelling.
		<p>And the original US markings intact, as required by US policy and by NATO policy.
		<p>If any of you are familar with our current security systems, you'll know how many of them are based on individual identities, individual access rights.
		<p>Data-centric security allows us to work with individual identities and access - and it allows us to work with nations, mission groups, etc.
		<p>Whatever makes the most operational sense.
		<p>Let that sink in for a moment.
		<p>Whatever makes the most operational sense.
		<p>Some of our developers are pretty smartalecky. They joke about this demo: "Hey, I just sent an email! Party like it's 1990!"
		<p>Ladies and gentlemen you just watch an email travel in real time between two systems
		<p>What happened under the covers?
		<p>A US policy enforcement point verified that the soldier who sent the message was allowed to send it. In fact, first it verified that they were allowed to access the medical record. Another policy enforcement point verified that this information was allowed to go to Canada.
		<p>That same policy enforcement point then translated all of the US labelling and protection to Coalition labelling and protection
		<p>When it hit Canada, another policy enforcement point translated Coalition labelling and protection to Canadian labelling and protection
		<p>Finally, when the Canadian operator attempted to access that email, another policy enforcement point verified that they were allowed to access it.

		<p>A moment ago, I said that our secure email started with US national protection and labelling.
		<p>That that was translated to coalition labelling and protection.
		<p>And translated again to Canadian labelling and protection.
		<p>PAUSE
		<p>This is a huge problem in the field today. We've all seen cases where tactical unit communication is limited. Team 1 can talk to Team 2 and Team 3, but not to Team 4, so any messages from Team 1 to Team 4 have to be relayed via Team 2 or 3.
		<p>SHAKE HEAD. PAUSE
		<p>When the American sent the email, they didn't need to know anything about Coalition or Canadian labelling or protection. They just sent it.
		<p>They didn't even need to know who the Canadian recipient was. Just their general location or role.
		<p>Policy enforcement points, configured to respect national and coalition MOUs and mission parameters, took care of all of that.
		<p>In real time.
		<p>We tested national and cross domain email all last week. In real time. This works. Time permitting, we will do even more interesting tests next week.
		<p>But we are taking it slowly, deliberately. We've done a lot in a very short time, but we have a lot left to do to make this field ready.
		<p>But I can tell you this. Data-centric security works.
		<p>And it allows us to do a lot that cannot be done today.
		<p>I'm not a technology guy. I used to drive boats. But I get this.
		<p>Data-centric security allows us to work the way we always thought we should.
		<p>Data-centric security allows us to do what makes sense. Not that what the IT guys tell us we can do, but what we need to.

		<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we've just walked through a well understood scenario: multi-nation MEDEVAC with hostile forces.
		<p>We've see a secure chat room used to discuss the scenario. We've seen eyes-only information in that chat room. And we've talked about that room being accessed via MNX.
		<p>We've seen total situational awareness picture. And we've seen that picture change in real time based on authorization and need to know.
		<p>And we've seen email being sent quickly and easily, to transfer a file, the way everyone is used to working. But everything about that email exchange was secure, and none of the users needed to sweat the details.
		<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we've seen data-centric security. We've seen problems solved the way they should be.
