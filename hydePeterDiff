DO THE THREE -> lines NEXT

NOTES

1)  _config.yml

tagline and description could/should be quoted
no description of Peter Whittaker, just a tagline
version numbers are different (Peter 1.0.0, Hyde 2.1.0)
paginate in Hyde probably better (5 instead of 1)
Hyde has dependencies (markdown, redcarpet)

Thinking of removing Custom vars and dependencies completely, seeing what breaks. Likely to use Paginate of 1 (seems more sensible now I've poked about - one post per page). Will quote, add a description.

2) _includes/head.html

Hyde has more expansive http-equiv for utf-8; also has x-ua-compatible, ie=edge
Hyde has hyde.css (duh) and a googleapi stylesheet
The icons are different (H for Hyde Vs P for Poole)

3) _includes/sidebar.html

The whole reason we are here.
Basic template to automagically apply sidebar; pages that should have a sidebar should have "layout: page" in the front-matter (see Hyde README)
Uses sticky sidebar (see hyde.css)
See the README.md for use of class in body to specify theme

4) _layouts/default.html

Hyde has more expansive <html... - not surprising, see more expansive head.html
Hyde has DOCTYPE
Hyde includes sidebar (duh)
Hyde specifies content and container classes in opposite order
Peter has more expansive content specification
Peter has footer, copyright, time, a lot of cool autogeneration stuff

5) _layouts/page.html

Hyde uses <div..., Peter uses <article... - otherwise the same

6) _layouts/post.html

Hyde uses <div..., Peter uses <article...
Hyde uses <div..., Peter uses <aside...
Peter uses more expansive specification, more bling, to set time of posts
Peter adds the baseurl to the posturl
SO article (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4781077/html5-best-practices-section-header-aside-article-tags) has interesting commentary on aside, article, etc. Hmm....

7) date-based directories

Generated from post dates

8) _site/404.html

Hyde has more expansive <html, <http-equiv... (see above)
Hyde has hyde.css, the googleapis
Different icons, etc.
Hyde has sidebar poop

404 is auto-generated, yes?

9) CNAME

Why is it there?

No idea, not referenced by any files. Should/could it be deleted?
Ah ha! According to http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/, this is required if you use a custom domain name. I can easily delete it from my copy of Hyde.

10) _site/about/index.html

Autogenerated from about.md, correct?
Hyde contains usual more expansive stuff
Hyde uses rss-xml, Peter uses atom-xml
Hyde contains the sidebar, etc.

11) _site/atom.xml

Hyde contains a ton more stuff, not sure how that got included
WAIT! See 13, below. Peter has no posts, therefore atom is just title, etc.,
but Hyde has pages marked as posts, therefore atom.xml contains all post content.

12) _site/index.html

Not surprising these would differ, these are built using index.html, defaults, etc.12) _site/index.html

13) atom.xml

Hyde doesn't use baseurl
Basic structure is main part (title, followed by posts)
Baseurl must not be set in Peter, because generated files (see 11) do not differ in basic URL structure (where it exists: title, etc.)

14) index.html

See 6, etc.
Hyde uses <div..., Peter uses <article...
Peter uses more expansive specification, more bling, to set time of posts
